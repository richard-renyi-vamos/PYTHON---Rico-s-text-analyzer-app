Creating a Python app that counts words in a text document and displays the results in a GUI can be a fun project. You can achieve this by using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface and Python's built-in functions for text processing. Here's a step-by-step guide:

Install Tkinter: Ensure that you have Tkinter installed. Tkinter is included in the standard Python library, so you likely don't need to install it separately.

Create a Python Script: You can create a Python script to handle the word counting and GUI. Here's a basic example:

python
Copy code
import tkinter as tk
from tkinter import filedialog
from tkinter import messagebox

def count_words():
    file_path = filedialog.askopenfilename()
    if not file_path:
        return

    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        text = file.read()
        words = text.split()
        word_count = len(words)

    result_label.config(text=f"Word Count: {word_count}")

# Create a GUI window
window = tk.Tk()
window.title("Word Count App")

# Create a button to select a text file
open_button = tk.Button(window, text="Open Text File", command=count_words)
open_button.pack(pady=10)

# Create a label to display the word count
result_label = tk.Label(window, text="", font=('Helvetica', 16))
result_label.pack()

# Run the GUI application
window.mainloop()
This script creates a simple GUI with a button to open a text file, counts the words in the selected file, and displays the word count.

Run the Application: Save this script with a .py extension and run it using a Python interpreter. You'll see a window that allows you to select a text file, and it will display the word count.
Remember that this is a basic example. You can further enhance the application by adding error handling, support for different file types, and more advanced features. Feel free to customize it to fit your needs.

I hope this helps you get started on your Python word count app! If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, please let me know. üòäüêçüìä
